This is the `www` folder where all the magic happens. Here's a list of the folders in it and their content :
- `css` : Folder containing .css files used in the styling of the app.
- `img` : Folder containing all the images used in the app.
- `js` : Folder containing the JavaScript files used for the app logic.
- `lib` : Folder containing all the libraries used in the app.
- `templates` : HTML files used in each of the views (step in the interface).
